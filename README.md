# EECE230Project
Project we had to do in our Data Structures with C++ course in the American University of Beirut (AUB)

Project is far from finished, there are many functions that are not working which I hope I will fix over time. The course where I had to do this is done, so I guess I'll fix it just for fun. I'll try to find the project description and upload it later on.
